```

## Resources 

- shinytest2 main documentation: <https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2/articles/use-application-audit.html#load-testing-with-shinytest2> 

Shinyloadtest can use shinytest2 for the recording. This is useful since shinytest2 has a full toolbelt of interaction options and can integrate with CI/CD pipelines. 

## Load testing

```{r}
library(shinytest2)

shinyloadtest::record_session()
```
