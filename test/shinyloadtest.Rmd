## Secret management 

The Connect API key is stored as the r environment variable `connect_api_key`. It can be edited/modified using the usethis package with: 
```r
library(usethis)
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

## Load testing

Test a single app that has been deployed to Connect. Use the URL from the "open solo" mode on Connect.  
 - Solo mode is important. This URL, when opened with developer options, doesn't work: `https://colorado.posit.co/rsc/connect/#/apps/d2c40c48-ae0b-48d8-888a-e8626322565d/access`

```{r}
library(shinyloadtest)

shinyloadtest::record_session(target_app_url='https://colorado.posit.co/rsc/content/d2c40c48-ae0b-48d8-888a-e8626322565d/',
                              connect_api_key=Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"))
```

This generates a recording.log file which is the "typical user interacting with the app" which we will use for load testing. 

Download and install shinycannon: <https://rstudio.github.io/shinyloadtest/articles/shinycannon.html> 

The below is using a windows OS, but can be modified for other OS.
